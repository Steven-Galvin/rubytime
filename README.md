# Rubytime


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rubytime', git: 'https://www.github.com/tenebrousedge/rubytime.git'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

In order to get the database set up, you need to create a postgresql user account for the test database, and one for the live database as well.

    $ sudo -u postgres createuser rubytime -p
    $ sudo -u postgres createuser rubytime_test -p

> Note:
Passwords are required unless you want to [reconfigure postgres](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23375740/pgconnectionbad-fe-sendauth-no-password-supplied).

Then you can create the necessary tables by running:

    $ sudo -u postgres psql -d postgres -f ./scripts/create_databases.sql
    $ rake db:migrate
    $ RACK_ENV='test' rake db:migrate

You will also need to edit the env.example file to contain the correct username and password for your postgres users, and rename it to `.env`.

Finally, start the app by running `rackup`.

## Heroku Deployment
